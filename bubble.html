            In this quadrant, <strong>Transport air, land, water</strong> sits in the upper right corner, in the bubble of luxury, high intensity. Its energy intensity (around 20 MJ $) is higher than the median of the full sample. The income elasticity (&gt; 1) is also higher than the average: that is, when income grows, people spend more on transport, grow faster, and hence a larger share of energy consumption.
            The size of this bubble is moderate. The energy footprint of this category is very important in total consumption: the demand of high-income people for air, land and sea transportation is driving more and more, and exacerbating the uneven consumption of social energy.
